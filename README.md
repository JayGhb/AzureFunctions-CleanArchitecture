# Azure Functions - Clean Architecture
![CI/CD](https://github.com/JayGhb/AzureFunctions-CleanArchitecture/actions/workflows/main_azurefunctionscleanarchitecture.yml/badge.svg)

This is a reference project to accompany the "An application with respect to itself" series of posts. The project's aim is to showcase the use of five, in my opinion, core aspects that each production system of the appropriate size & significance must incorporate and yet they are so often overlooked, resulting in substantial damage in terms of arising production issues, efficiency when solving such, lost data and many more.

## Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

## Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.
